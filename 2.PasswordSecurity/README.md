# 2. Password Security

This week, we will explore the concept of information entropy, especially in the context of passwords.
Also, we break some passwords in the process and explore how the breaking could be made a little harder.
Finally, we think about the lifetime of passwords and how to use them more efficiently.

There is also a bonus task if you like to think about the security of one physical keypad.

# Task 1: The concept of information entropy

*Unpredictability* is the most fundamental concept in cyber security.
Everything relies on it underneath. If you want to keep something confidential, and access-controlled, you usually use a **secret**, that only you and other authorised parties know.

Unpredictability and uncertainty [^1] are the base for secrets. A secret is not good if someone can guess it. If we had a perfect secret, nobody could guess it. Unfortunately, sometimes the perfect secret can be very challenging to create and use in practice. 

So instead, we settle for less. Is the less enough?

We can measure the unpredictability with [Shannon Entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory))[^2] (aka information entropy).
Entropy is a property of _random phenomenons_; a property of the probability distribution of a random phenomenon, as follows:

$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_b P(x_i)$, where

- $H(X)$ is the entropy of the random variable $X$.
- $P(x_i)$ represents the probability of occurrence of the $i$-th possible value of $X$.
- The summation is over all $n$ distinct possible values of $X$.
- $\log_b$ is the logarithm of the base $b$, where $b$ is typically 2 (binary logarithm) in the context of information theory, but can be any base depending on the context. With the base 2, the unit of entropy is *bits (or “shannons”).* 


In short, entropy **measures the amount of randomness**.
If the secret has high entropy, the probability distribution will give very little information about the underlying random phenomenon.
You can learn more about information theory from [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory/moderninfotheory/v/information-entropy), for example. 

One of the most common secrets is passwords, which are the focus of this week. Overall, entropy is important in cryptography, but we don't handle that in this course. 
## Entropy and passwords

The general probability of guessing the password is based on the amount of overall combinations, or *permutations*.
This assumes that you know the requirements for password generation.
In that case, we can calculate the permutations of the password as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Permutations} &= N^L \\
\text{Where:} \\
& N \text{ is the number of possible characters.} \\
& L \text{ is the length of the password.}
\end{align*}
$$

For example, if a password can contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, the calculation is as follows:

> Let's say there are 26 lowercase letters, 26 uppercase letters, 10 digits, and 10 special characters. The total number of characters $N$ is then 26 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 72.

Entropy calculation of the passwords is similarly based on the length and the probability distribution of the characters. 
Probability distribution depends on the available character set.

If we apply the password permutation calculation for the entropy formula, the total entropy calculation is simplified as follows for *truly randomly generated passwords*: 

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Entropy} &= L \times \log_2 N \\
\text{Where:} \\
& N \text{ is the number of possible characters. } \\
& L \text{ is the length of the password.}
\end{align*}
$$

So, we can calculate the entropy. But what these entropy values mean by itself? Alone, not much. They need to be compared to the state-of-the-art brute forcing processes. 
As the computational resources increase over the time, so does the recommended amount of entropy for a strong password. 
Overall, the required level of entropy also depends on the threat model.


If we look at the [Hive Systems password table (2023)](https://www.hivesystems.io/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green), 12 characters long passwords with lowercase and uppercase characters along with numbers might be the minimum for the generic threat model with *53 year brute force time*.

That is based on using **RTX 4090 with 12 GPUs against MD5** hashes. 

This will get us $12 \times \log_2 62 = 71.45$ bits of entropy.

Entropy calculation can be hard to do correctly; the above applies only for *truly randomly generated values*.

> Following exercises can be done either just with paper, calculator or Python, for example. 
### Task 1A) Entropy and regex patterns

On the Moodle exam, you will be given Perl influenced [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) describing the password requirements.
You will also be given an example password.

> Calculate the entropy in 2 decimal accuracy.

See, for example, [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/)and [https://regexr.com/](https://regexr.com/) to better understand regexes. 

### Task 1B) Entropy and minimum requirements

One fascinating thing about minimum requirements in passwords is that they actually *reduce the entropy of the passwords*, assuming that the length and allowed characters stays the same.

Certain password policies, while intended to increase security, might inadvertently lower the overall entropy of the password space by imposing restrictions that limit the total number of possible password combinations.
Minimum requirements might still increase the security, if the expected human behaviour is prone to create passwords which are easier to guess with [dictionary attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attacks). 
Entropy estimation can be hard when also noting that. 

In practice, this means that from the total combinations, we just remove or do not note those which are not possible any more, because of the minimum requirements.

You are given a regex pattern and value how many passwords can be broken in a second.

> Calculate the time in seconds for guaranteed guess of this password with minimum requirements.

The given value is based on [the avarage and variance of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 breaking MD5 hashes.](https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/hashcat&eval=8b64c180eac0ce4c97f0d73d774dbb6161bedb5f#metrics)

# Task 2: Practical brute forcing

> Return tasks as Moodle exam

So far, we have thought breaking passwords just in theoretical level. Let's try out in practice with a couple popular tools. 

Typically, passwords are hashed into the system's database to make it more difficult to obtain the original value; it means that we need to compute hashes to crack the passwords.

You can choose yourself which methods to use, even just using Python works to a certain degree, but the use of specific tools is recommended. 

Particularly, we can use either **hashcat** [^11] or **John the Ripper** [^12].

Explore short introductions from the separate files.
 * [`hashcat`](hashcat.md)
 * [`john`](john.md)

When considering which one to use, CLI interface of `john` might be more flexible for providing more configurations and customisations which can get you started.
`hashcat` is less flexible, but focuses on raw performance instead.

Note that since efficient password breaking requires the use of GPU, installing tools to your host machine would give the most performance, unless you mess around with PCI pass-through with virtualisation.

> MD5 hashing algorithm is used as an example because of its historical value. It should not be used any more, *at all*.

## Task 2A) MD5 and integer values

The first task is rather simple.
In the Moodle exam, you will be provided a MD5 hash of the integer value. You know that these integers have exactly 8 digits. 

> Brute force the integer and return the result.

## Task 2B) MD5 with masking and salt

Having only numbers in the passwords is hopefully not used much in practice.
Having a mix of both letters and digits is much more common.

By knowing some requirements of how the password was created, can we still brute force it efficiently?

At first part, use [masking attack](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack) to reduce the possibilities of the password.

Secondly, we additionally add [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) for the password with the combination of masking.

## Task 2C) `argon2` and brute forcing with wordlists

Kalle found this [nice wordlist from the internet](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt) which lists top 200 passwords from 2023, according to some unknown factors.

Kalle *misunderstood* the list a bit; he thought that these *are the best passwords* from 2023. 
And he decided to develop *even more secure method* to create passwords for his services, based on the list.

He decided to implement the following “secure” password generation protocol, and put it public to the internet:
 * Select one digit in random
 * Select one word from the list in random
 * Select one digit in random

Overall, the password characters should be generated in order based on the previous.

However, the worst happened and some service leaked the Kalle's password, with hash and corresponding salt. 

While Kalle's protocol was not secure, ***not at all***, the underlying service's technical choices made it harder to crack the password.

The service used one state-of-the-art hashing function [argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2), which is [key derivation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function.); in practice is it calculates the hash many times to slow the brute forcing process which also improving weaker passwords in other means.
It is also designed to be resistant for GPU accelerated and paralleled computing.

> In the Moodle exam, you need to crack the Kalle's password.
>  
> The provided `argon2` hash configuration is **not the best practice**; it designed so that you will notice how slow it can be on relatively low count wordlist, while also making it possible to crack the password in rather short duration.

It is recommended to generate the whole wordlist based on the previous protocol, and then brute force with the final word list. Python implementation with [`argon2-cffi`](https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library might be the best choice here.  In that case, you need to configure `argon2` hasher correctly based on the given parameters in Moodle exam.
  * On a 6-year-old laptop, brute forcing should take around 20 minutes at maximum.
  * Make sure that you are able to correctly crack passwords before letting it run longer durations.

Also, you need to install `argon2` C implementation as well in Arch Linux; run `sudo pacman -Sy argon2` before Python bindings work.

Note:`hashcat` [does not support argon2 yet](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues/1966). 

## Task 3: Lifetime of the passwords

```

On high level, it describes about the traditional process when user creates and uses passwords, until there is a need to change it because of the breach or some other information leak.
It also notes some good practices on using the passwords on the systems. 

> Your task is to write an essay of two A4 pages (around 800 words) about the *best practises of using and managing passwords and implementing password-based systems, considering the entire lifetime of the passwords.*

> Consider the following when writing the essay:

 * On task 1, we thought about entropy. Why it is very difficult to measure entropy for human-generated passwords? And that entropy is probably very low.
 * What is the role of using hashes **and salts** in the passwords? Check [rainbow table attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table).
 * Explore state-of-the-art hashing functions in password context.
	 * Why we use key stretching algorithms when we hash passwords?
	 * Consider the importance of resistance of hashing functions in password context (e.g. you do not get benefit for calculating the hashes on graphic card, memory usage and parallelism).
	 * Usually acceptable user experience delay for interactive authentication is `<=500ms`. `bcrypt` is considered to be better choice than `argon2` in that area. Why? It might be that there isn't single good algorithm for everything.
* Check services like [';--have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords). Why are they very important? Why you should never re-use your passwords?
	* Explore the impact of credential stuffing and dictionary attacks by using the breach data.
	* What is the impact of 2FA/MFA for entropy and in combat for credential stuffing?
* Consider the dilemma of usability and security in the password context.  Good passwords are typically hard to remember.  Are password managers with automatic breach notifications the solution?
* When thinking of your threat model, breaking the password is not about the time; rather, how much money your potential threat actors can invest for parallel computing.

You can also get ideas from the [xkcd comic about password strength](https://xkcd.com/936/).

# Task 4: Keypad (bonus task)

You encounter this locked door with this keypad.
You know that this lock model can be configured for 4, 5, 6, or 7-digit key codes.
The lock does not give you any else information during the key code attempt than the success light or fail light after a timeout when any input key is pressed last time. How many attempts do you need to get guaranteed success?

> Either include maths about your result or make a program to compute all the possibilities. Argument your results. Return this task to GitHub. Grading is strict for this task.
